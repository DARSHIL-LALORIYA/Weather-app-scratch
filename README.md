<h2>Introduction</h2>
I created a weather website landing page involves multiple steps, including fetching data from a OpenWeatherMap API, designing the user interface, and handling user interactions.
Having a functionality to take input from the user and show weather of desired input place.
Displaying Latitute , Longitude , Pressure , Windspeed , Description of weather and more!<br/>
The data for the information will come from OpenWeatherMap API , but feel free to use whatever API you wish. some good suggestions:
<ul>
  <li>Tomorrow.io API</li>
  <li>Stormglass API</li>
  <li>AccuWeather API</li>
</ul>
